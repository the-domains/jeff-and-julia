            <title><![CDATA[That is all we can say about this couple, their family, their friends, & their wedding day.  It was the perfect day from start to finish.  It all began at the Lincoln Hotel in Lincoln Park where the everyone prepared for the day.  The rooftop bar was the perfect location for the couple to see each other for the first look that which was very emotional.  We had a lot of fun photographing around the fabulous hotel, Lincoln Park and downtown Chicago.  The ceremony was at St. Alphonsus and from there we had a lot fun going for a snack at the Weiner Circle and few other locations.  The Salvatore was a fabulous setting to party the night away and celebrate a day to remember.  We wish Kristen and Jason all the best !!]]></title>
