title: Grace Ormonde is showcasing our newest endeavor called Jeffrey and Julia Woods ~Black Label~. This is something that we are really excited about. We have teamed up with Super 8mm cinematographer Andy Jackson of Portal Films. The three of us mesh so well together and the results are shared from a artistic point of view. By showing an image and then adding a few seconds of film footage you get a more holistic documentation of what happens in those moments.
