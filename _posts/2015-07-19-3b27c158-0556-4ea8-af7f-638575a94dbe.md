description: 'Jeffrey and Julia Woods are wedding photographers who care deeply about their clients, and you can see it in the way their images truly reflect each couple’s connection. We love the emotion and nuance they capture in every single frame, so we sat down with Julia to learn a little bit about their backgrounds and how they came to be the people and the photographers they are today.'
