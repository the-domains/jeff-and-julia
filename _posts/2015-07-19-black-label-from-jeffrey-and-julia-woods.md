description: Do you know how ~ when you’re at a movie and it’s really spellbinding … and toward the end you become totally mesmerized ~ waiting.  And then there’s a crescendo that builds higher and higher until the final moment. You are full of emotion and drained of emotion. You just sit there. The entire theatre is quiet. No one moves. Everyone is wrapped up in their own thoughts while the impact of the ending soaks in.
