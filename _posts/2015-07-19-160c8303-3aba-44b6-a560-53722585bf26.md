description: 'Do you know how ~ when you’re at a movie, and it’s spellbinding and toward the end you become totally mesmerized ~ waiting?  And then there’s a crescendo that builds higher and higher until the final moment. You are full of emotion and drained of emotion. You just sit there. The entire theatre is quiet. No one moves. Everyone is wrapped up in their thoughts while the impact of the ending soaks in.  That is what Jeffrey and Julia Woods have done. The images that you see here, are integrated and melded seamlessly into a film that will tell you the story behind each photo. - Bride Magazine'
