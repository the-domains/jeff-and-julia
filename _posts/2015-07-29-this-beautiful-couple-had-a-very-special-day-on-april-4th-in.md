### This beautiful couple had a very special day on April 4th in Chicago.  From the tear filled moments in the dressing rooms, to the laughter and promises made during the ceremony, to the romance and celebration of the reception, the Drake Hotel was the perfect setting for this perfect day.  Bambi and her team from BCR Events made everything seem effortless. The  brides desire to have an elegant and fun wedding were definitely accomplished.  We wish Meggie and Jeff a lifetime of elegance and fun!!
